R Presentation

There were problems with rendering slidify presentations on RPub or Github, result of render was blank.So I converted it to PDF that you can see. ALSO I did it using R Presentation, link is valid. 

I uploaded R Presentation files + Slidify files that unfortunately did not work.

Presentation includes 5 slides and I gave small feedback and info about Shiny

Enjoy,
Hope you liked it
